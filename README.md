# Predict Your Future - ML Project

This project demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow to predict user outcomes based on behavioral and transactional data.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used is `foodhub_order.csv`, containing user order behavior information. It is placed in the `data/` folder.

## 🔍 Features
- Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Classification using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting
- Model Evaluation (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, ROC/AUC)
- Exported as both `.ipynb` and `.html` for portability

## 🧰 Tech Stack
- Python 3
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ▶️ Running the Notebook
```bash
